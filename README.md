# Gender and Age Recognition using Python and OpenCV

This project implements gender and age recognition using a deep learning model with Python and OpenCV. It uses pre-trained models to predict the gender and age of a person from an image or video input.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless tensorflow numpy
